Certainly! Here is the revised version with "my" instead of "your":

## 1. Server URL:

In Postman, create a new request.
Set the Base URL to http://localhost:5000.
Refer to my server setup (e.g., server.js) to confirm the port number.

## 2. API Endpoints:

My code defines routes for various product management operations. These routes act as endpoints for my API.
Refer to the code in product.routes.ts to identify the specific endpoints I want to use (e.g., /api/products/create-product, /api/products/:productId).

## 3. Sending Requests:

Method: Choose the appropriate HTTP method for the desired operation based on the route definition.
POST: Create a new product (matches /api/products/create-product)
GET: Retrieve products (matches /api/products/) or a specific product (/api/products/:productId)
PUT: Update a product (/api/products/:productId)
DELETE: Delete a product (/api/products/:productId)

Headers (Optional):
Some routes might require specific headers depending on my implementation. Check the code or documentation for any necessary headers (e.g., Content-Type: application/json).
Body (Optional):
For creating or updating products, I'll need to provide a JSON object in the request body containing the product data (name, description, etc.) following the schema defined in my code.

## 4. Sending the Request:

Once I've configured the URL, method, headers (if needed), and body (if applicable), click the Send button in Postman.

## 5. Response:

If the request is successful, Postman will display the response from my server, which might be the newly created product information, a list of products, or a confirmation message for update/delete operations.
In case of errors, the response will typically contain an error code and message, helping me diagnose the issue.
Example:

To create a new product using the /api/products/create-product endpoint:

- Set method to POST.
- Set headers (if required) based on my code.
- In the body tab, create a JSON object with product details like name, description, etc.
  Click Send.

Postman will send the request to my local server, and the response will indicate whether the product was created successfully.
